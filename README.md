# fcc-weather-api-vanilla-js-no-JQuery-
A simple webpage that gets weather data from the freecodecamp api. I wanted to work with fetching async without using JQuery. For FCC users note that I used an additional API for better location information. If you want to "test-drive" this you will need to get your own api key. The instructions for this are in main.js.

The live-server in package.json is a simple cool hot-loader. Use npm i inside of the project folder, which will install live-server and normalize for css.

To run the hot loader, from the command line just navigate to the folder holding the index.html file and use the command live-server. This command can also be used with the path, in which case it would be live-server pathToFolder/thatIndex.htmlIsIn
